2 Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
1 Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
4 And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
3 Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,
6 But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
5 Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,
8 Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.
7 Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
