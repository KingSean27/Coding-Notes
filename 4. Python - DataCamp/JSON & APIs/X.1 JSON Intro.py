# Javascript object notation (JSON) is a data type originally created with Java but is now widely used
# it is easy for machines and humans alike, especially on the web
# JSON data is not tabular, records don't have to all have the same set of attributes
# they are similar to python dictionaries and can be nested

# we can use read_json to take in a json - use it to find the string of the data to load

import pandas as pd

# a = pd.read_json ()

# data types are guessed but can be specified with the dtype keyword argument
