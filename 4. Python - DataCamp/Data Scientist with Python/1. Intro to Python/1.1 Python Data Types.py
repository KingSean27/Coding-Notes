# As we already know we have a few data types:
# float
# int
# str
# bool


# we also have data structures:
# list [] , these are ordered and indexed numerically
# tuple
# dictionary


# use help() to see the documentation of functions
# or put a ? in front
help(round)

# data types are objects and have inbuilt methods that are associated with them
# these can be called with the . notation
